    Applies a specified quantum gate to each qubit within the provided list.

    This function is intended for use within the pyQPanda package, which facilitates
    quantum computing with quantum circuits and gates. It operates on a quantum circuit
    simulator or a quantum cloud service.

            gate (pywrap.QGate): 
                The quantum gate instance to be applied to each qubit.
            qubit_list (list of pyQPanda.Qubit): 
                A list of qubits to which the gate will be applied.

            A quantum gate represented as a callable that takes a qubit and an optional angle.

            The index of the qubit to which the gate will be applied.
        angle (float, optional): 
            The rotation angle for rotation gates. Defaults to None, which means no rotation is applied.

def draw_probability(list):
    """
    Generate a bar plot visualizing the probabilities of a quantum state.

    The function takes a dictionary containing quantum state keys and their corresponding
    probabilities, normalizes the probabilities, and plots them using a bar chart.

    Args:
        probability_dict (dict): 
            A dictionary where keys represent the quantum states and
            values represent their respective probabilities.

    Returns:
        None: 
            This function does not return a value. It plots the probabilities directly.

    Notes:
        The bar plot uses the Chinese font 'SimHei' and ensures that negative symbols are
        not displayed in the axes.
        The x-axis represents the quantum states, while the y-axis represents the
        probabilities.
        The function includes a grid on the y-axis for better readability.

    Generate a bar plot representing the probabilities of a quantum state from a given dictionary.

    The function configures Matplotlib to use SimHei font for better readability in Chinese characters.
    It filters out non-positive probabilities, calculates normalized probabilities, and then plots them as a bar chart.
    The plot includes a grid and labeled axes for clarity.
    This utility is intended for use within the pyQPanda package, which is designed for programming quantum computers.
